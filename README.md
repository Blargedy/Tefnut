# Tefnut
A system for the management of 3D printer filament. Based on cereal containers as individual dryboxes for spools of filament.

# Migration from thingiverse to github is WIP. This message will be removed once migration is complete

## Goal
The primary purpose of Tefnut is to keep filament clean of dust/debris to avoid jams and clogs, and can also help with keeping filament dry. I found there is too much air leakage in the system to maintain a low humidity long term without regular swapping of large amounts of dessecant. That being said, with regular swapping of large amounts of dessecant it is possible to keep each filament completely dry.

Need to move your spool of filament into a dry-box while still using the Universal Auto-Rewind Spool Holder? This set of files will let you do so. This set of modifications and new custom parts moves [VincentGroenhuis'](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3338467) rewinder into a Rubbermaid 1776473 21-Cup Dry Food Container. When combined with a panel mounted pneumatic fitment or mmu tube holder you can print directly from this dry-box.

Need to keep your spools dry and clean, but the folding lid of the mmu compatible printer enclosure drops your dry-box to the ground? This slide-down box-holder keeps the dry-box in place during lid-lifting maintenance. This holder was designed for this cereal box by Rubbermaid, which can be used as an individual-roll dry-box.

In order to lower friction in the path of the filament loading to the MMU, I am stepping up the size of the tubes from 4 mm to 6 mm outer diameters. I was not able to find PC6-M10*1 pneumatic fittings, which would normally be used to fit 6mm tubing to the adapter vertigo235 designed, for a reasonable price. This is to give a similar push-to-connect interface for 6mm tubing as the pneumatic ones. It won't be air tight, but it is tight enough to feed the filament in correctly. An added bonus is that you can fit the tubes in one at a time instead of the juggling act of all at once like with the stock mmu.

These pieces are designed to be used with my individual-spool drybox inserts. The outer fitment is a panel mounted push-fit holder for 6mm outer diameter tubing, and the inside fitment is a funnel guide for filament being pulled from spools that are almost out of filament.

The lifting lid of the MMU compatible prusa enclosure becomes very back heavy when five of my dryboxes are on top. While servicing the printer I pushed the lid up too high and it flipped all the way back on itself, destroying the hinges, and several of my rewinders and tube adapters. In order to avoid this happening again I designed an anchor point for the lid intended for a 2mm twisted steel cable to loop through and create an over-lifting protection. I imagine it would also work with nylon cords or twine if they are thin enough.
