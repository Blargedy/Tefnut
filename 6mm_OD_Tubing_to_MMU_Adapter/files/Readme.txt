This is to guide 6mm outer diameter/4mm inner diameter tubing into the MMU, without the need for expensive pneumatic adapters.

The original file is included for reference, and in case SW complains it needs the reference step file.
Finished part is called "mmu2-rear-PTFE-holder(M1).sldprt", and the exported STL file is called "OD6mmTubeToMMU_Adapter.STL".

Prints well in PETG.
