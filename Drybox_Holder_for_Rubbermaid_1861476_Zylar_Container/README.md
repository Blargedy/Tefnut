Need to keep your spools dry and clean, but the folding lid of the [mmu compatible printer enclosure](https://blog.prusa3d.com/mmu2s-printer-enclosure_30215/) drops your dry-box to the ground? This slide-down box-holder keeps the dry-box in place during lid-lifting maintenance. This holder was designed for [this](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00BEUDWIC/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_cDVBDbEDKND4F?tag=1) cereal box by Rubbermaid, which can be used as an individual-roll dry-box.
